I created a dictionary application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. During the development of the application, I fetched APIs from the Free Dictionary API site (https://dictionaryapi.dev) using the fetch method and displayed the results dynamically on the screen. As an additional feature, you can hear the pronunciation of the searched word by pressing the audio button. If you search for a non-existent word, the system will give you a warning.![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f107aea0-7bcf-4de6-9567-b39802c4f385)
